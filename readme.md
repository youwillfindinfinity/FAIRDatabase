## Quick Start (Docker)

Requires only [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. Choose one of the two options below — **Option A** for a zero-config quickstart, **Option B** if you want to set your own passwords.

---

> The Flask app runs **in a container** (`fairdatabase-flask`, defined directly in `backend/docker-compose.yml`). `docker compose up -d` starts the whole stack — Supabase **and** the app. You do **not** create a venv or run `./run.sh` for normal use; that is only for host-based development (see [Optional: run Flask on the host](#optional-run-flask-on-the-host-for-development)).

### Option A: Fully Automatic Setup (Zero Config)

#### Step 1 — Generate config automatically

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh --auto
```

> The generated passwords (including the Supabase Studio dashboard password) are printed to your terminal. Save them.

> **Admin user:** `--auto` cannot guess who the admin is, so it leaves `ADMIN_EMAIL=` blank (it prints a `[WARN]`). To get an auto-promoted admin, set `ADMIN_EMAIL=<your-email>` in `backend/.env` after this step, then (re)start the stack. `_bootstrap_admin` promotes that account to `admin` on every boot, and the value is preserved across future `bootstrap.sh` re-runs — so you set it once. Without it, assign roles manually via `/admin/users`.

> **Plugin selection** Setup your plugins via the allowlist (FAIRDB_PLUGINS) or the reject list (FAIRDB_PLUGINS_DISABLED)
#### Step 2 — Start the stack

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d
```

Wait ~30 seconds for services to become healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All key services (`supabase-auth`, `supabase-kong`, `supabase-db`, `fairdatabase-flask`) should show `(healthy)`.

> `supabase-db-init` is a one-shot setup container — it will show `Exited (0)` once finished. That is expected, not a failure.

> No `.env` host-edit step is needed: the container reaches the database and Supabase by Docker service name (`db`, `kong`), set in the override's `environment:` block, which takes precedence over `backend/.env`.

#### Step 3 — Register and log in

There is no default user account. You must register before you can log in:

1. Go to **http://localhost:5000/auth/register** and create an account with any email and password.
2. You will be redirected to **http://localhost:5000/auth/login** — use the same credentials to log in.

`ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM=true` is set by default so no email verification is required.

> **Admin promotion:** `_bootstrap_admin` only runs at Flask startup, so a user set in `ADMIN_EMAIL` is promoted to `admin` on the *next* boot after they register. After registering that account, run `docker compose restart flask-app` once. Full order: set `ADMIN_EMAIL` → `up` → register that email → `docker compose restart flask-app`.

---

### Option B: Manual Setup (Set Your Own Passwords)

#### Step 1 — Create the environment file

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

#### Step 2 — Set your passwords

Open `backend/.env` and change these three variables from `change-me` to values of your choice:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — PostgreSQL database password.
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` — Password for the Supabase Studio dashboard (username is always `supabase`).
- `SECRET_KEY` — Secret key for Flask session security. Use a long random string.

**Optional variables (leave as defaults unless needed):**
- `ADMIN_EMAIL` — Email auto-promoted to `admin` on every boot. Set it now and it is preserved across `bootstrap.sh` re-runs. Leave empty to disable auto-promotion (assign roles manually via `/admin/users`).
- `SITE_URL` — Where the app runs (default: `http://localhost:5000`).
- `SMTP_*` — Email server settings. Leave blank if you don't need email sending.
- `DISABLE_SIGNUP` — Set to `true` to prevent new user registrations.
- `ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM` — Set to `true` so new users skip email verification (recommended for local testing).

#### Step 3 — Bootstrap and start the stack

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh

cd backend
docker compose up -d
```

Wait ~30 seconds for services to become healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All key services (`supabase-auth`, `supabase-kong`, `supabase-db`, `fairdatabase-flask`) should show `(healthy)`.

> `supabase-db-init` is a one-shot setup container — it will show `Exited (0)` once finished. That is expected, not a failure.

#### Step 4 — Register and log in

There is no default user account. You must register before you can log in:

1. Go to **http://localhost:5000/auth/register** and create an account with any email and password.
2. You will be redirected to **http://localhost:5000/auth/login** — use the same credentials to log in.

`ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM=true` is set by default so no email verification is required.

> **Admin promotion:** `_bootstrap_admin` only runs at Flask startup, so a user set in `ADMIN_EMAIL` is promoted to `admin` on the *next* boot after they register. After registering that account, run `docker compose restart flask-app` once. Full order: set `ADMIN_EMAIL` → `up` → register that email → `docker compose restart flask-app`.

---

### Optional: run Flask on the host (for development)

Only needed for active app development (live reload, debugger) — **not** for normal use, where Flask runs in the `fairdatabase-flask` container.

To avoid two Flask instances fighting over port `5000`, run the Supabase stack **without** the app container:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d --scale flask-app=0     # Supabase + db-init only
```

Then point host Flask at the published ports — change these three values in `backend/.env` (re-apply after every `bootstrap.sh` run, which overwrites them):

```
POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
POSTGRES_PORT=5433
SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

And run the app from `backend/`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./run.sh
```

---

### Access the Application

Once everything is running:

| Service | URL | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Main Application** | http://localhost:5000 | The FAIRDatabase app — register and log in here. |
| **Database Dashboard** | http://localhost:3000 | Supabase Studio — view and manage database tables. Login: username `supabase`, password = your `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`. |
| **API Endpoint** | http://localhost:8000 | Supabase API — used internally by the app. |

### Stopping and Resetting

If you need to stop the application or want to wipe the data and start over:

```bash
cd backend

# Stop all services but KEEP your data
docker compose down

# Stop all services AND DELETE all data (factory reset)
docker compose down -v
```

### Selecting which plugins to load

Feature plugins under `backend/plugins/` (currently **pbpk** and
**horizontal_fl**) are auto-discovered and mounted at Flask boot. To run only a
subset, set these in `backend/.env` (both default to empty = load everything):

```bash
# Allowlist — load ONLY these plugins (folder names, comma-separated)
FAIRDB_PLUGINS=pbpk

# Denylist — load everything EXCEPT these (applied after the allowlist)
FAIRDB_PLUGINS_DISABLED=horizontal_fl
```

Then `docker compose up -d` (or `docker compose restart flask-app` if already
running). The loader logs each skipped plugin at startup
(`docker compose logs flask-app | grep -i plugin`).

Notes:
- Names are the plugin **folder** names (`pbpk`, `horizontal_fl`).
- This is a runtime switch — the image still contains all plugin code and its
  Python deps. A disabled plugin's routes, schema, and storage buckets are
  simply never mounted/applied; nothing else changes.
- A plugin whose `required_packages` aren't installed also skip-mounts itself
  with a warning — independent of this allowlist.

### Database schemas

Application-level schemas are applied **automatically** on fresh DB init and on every Flask container boot:

**Core schemas:**
- `backend/migrate_schema.sql` — `_fd` schema for CSV-upload metadata and tables
- `backend/rbac_schema.sql` — Role-based access control: user roles, dataset grants, RLS policies, audit tables
- `backend/demo_schema.sql` — Public demo API support

**Kernel schemas** (applied by the plugin loader at Flask boot):
- `backend/kernel/sql/001_kernel.sql` — `_fd.plugin_audit` (the generic mutation audit log used by `kernel.audit`)
- `backend/kernel/sql/002_dp_budget.sql` — `_fd.fl_epsilon_budget` and the `metadata_tables.fl_eligible` column (backing `kernel.dp_budget`)

**Plugin schemas** (each plugin owns its own; applied by the loader from its manifest's `sql_migrations`):
- `backend/plugins/pbpk/sql/001_schema.sql` — PBPK parameter sets, runs, and run artifacts
- `backend/plugins/horizontal_fl/sql/001_schema.sql` — FL tasks, rounds, clients, round submissions

**How it works:**
- On a fresh `db` volume, only the **core** schemas are mounted into `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/migrations/` and run by Postgres at first init (in order: `100-fd-schema`, `101-fd-rbac`, `103-fd-demo`). Order matters: `rbac_schema.sql` defines `_fd.current_role()`, which plugin RLS policies depend on.
- On every `flask-app` container start, the entrypoint re-applies the core schemas via `psql` (see `docker-entrypoint.sh`), and the Flask app factory then runs the **plugin loader**, which applies kernel SQL and every discovered plugin's `sql_migrations`. All files are idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`, `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE POLICY IF NOT EXISTS`), so re-runs are safe.

**Custom schemas:** New plugin schemas just go in `plugins/<name>/sql/`; the loader picks them up — no `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-entrypoint.sh` edits needed. Core schemas (rare) follow the same mount + entrypoint pattern as the existing three.

### PBPK simulation artifacts

The `/model/runs/<run_id>/artifacts` endpoints accept binary outputs (jpg, png, mp4, vtk/vtu/vtp) attached to a persisted simulation run. Bytes live in the Supabase Storage bucket `pbpk-artifacts`; catalog rows in `_fd.pbpk_run_artifacts` carry the RBAC.

- **Bucket** — declared in `plugins/pbpk/plugin.py` and created automatically on Flask boot by the plugin loader's `bootstrap_plugin_buckets`. Idempotent; "already exists" is a no-op.
- **Storage RLS** — apply once, by hand, when you want browsers to read objects directly via signed URLs without going through Flask:
  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=$POSTGRES_SECRET psql \
      -h $POSTGRES_HOST -p $POSTGRES_PORT \
      -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB_NAME \
      -f backend/plugins/pbpk/sql/pbpk_storage_policies.sql
  ```
  Until applied, the bucket is reachable only via the service-role client (the Flask backend), which is fine for the PoC — every browser read flows through `/model/runs/<id>/artifacts` and the backend issues short-lived signed URLs.
- **Limits** — 200 MB per file; signed URL TTL 10 minutes. Allowed types: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `video/mp4`, and the `.vtk` / `.vtu` / `.vtp` mesh family (sent as `application/octet-stream`).
- **Upload example**
  ```bash
  curl -b cookies.txt -F "file=@conc_field.png" \
       http://localhost:5000/model/runs/42/artifacts
  ```

### Troubleshooting

**`ImportError: libexpat.so.1: cannot open shared object file`** when the `flask-app` container starts.

The PBPK simulation module (`PBKFAIRModel/`) depends on `python-libsbml`, which is a Python wrapper around a C library that links against `libexpat`. The base `python:3.10-slim` image does not include it. The Dockerfile installs it via `apt-get install libexpat1`. If you ever swap the base image or strip apt packages, libsbml will fail to import and `flask-app` will enter a restart loop. The full set of system libs required by the image is: `libpq5` (psycopg2), `libexpat1` (libsbml), `postgresql-client` (entrypoint migrations), `curl` (healthcheck). If you add scientific Python packages later (e.g. cvxpy, hdf5-based libs), expect to extend this list — check the import error for the missing `.so` and add the matching debian package.

**Supabase services crash-loop on an existing/migrated DB volume** (`supabase-pooler`, `realtime`, or `auth` restarting; logs show `28P01 password authentication failed`, `3D000 database "_supabase" does not exist`, `3F000 schema "_supavisor"/"_realtime" does not exist`, or `42501 must be owner of function uid`).

Root cause: the `supabase/postgres` image only runs the SQL in `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` on **first** DB init. On a pre-existing volume those internals are never (re)applied. This is now handled automatically by the **`db-init`** one-shot service in `docker-compose.yml`: it runs on every `up` *before* realtime/auth/supavisor/flask (`depends_on: service_completed_successfully`) and idempotently re-syncs internal role passwords, creates the `_supabase` database, the `_supavisor`/`_realtime` schemas, and repairs `auth` ownership. If you still see these errors:

- Confirm `db-init` exited 0: `docker compose logs supabase-db-init`.
- If `roles.sql` warns about auth failure, the volume's **`postgres`** superuser password itself drifted from `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (db-init connects over TCP and cannot self-heal that one). Manual repair, run inside the DB container which trusts the local socket:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it supabase-db psql -U postgres -c \
    "ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD '<value of POSTGRES_PASSWORD in backend/.env>';"
  docker compose up -d   # db-init then fixes the remaining roles
  ```
- Never re-run `bootstrap.sh --auto` / `--rotate-secrets` against a volume that has data — it refuses by design (it would desync `JWT_SECRET`/`VAULT_ENC_KEY`). To intentionally start clean, delete `backend/volumes/db/data` first (**destroys all data**).

**Editing a bind-mounted file then `docker restart`ing fails on WSL2** with `mount ... no such file or directory` (e.g. after editing `volumes/pooler/pooler.exs` or any `volumes/db/*`).

Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend caches the inode of bind-mounted files; editing one (especially from the Windows side or via an editor that replaces rather than truncates) invalidates the reference. `docker restart <svc>` then cannot re-establish the mount. **Recreate, do not restart:**

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --no-deps <service>
```

If the Docker CLI itself hangs (`docker ps`/`docker info` time out — a separate WSL2 wedge, often triggered by a stuck `docker exec` against a missing database), restart Docker Desktop from Windows; running containers and the DB volume are unaffected.

## Quick Start (Podman)

```bash
# One-time setup
bash scripts/podman-setup.sh

# Then same workflow as Docker
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your passwords
bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
cd backend
podman-compose up -d
```

---

## Running Tests

### Containerized tests (recommended)

Run the full test suite against the live Supabase stack:

```bash
cd backend

# Unit + integration tests (pytest)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm test-runner

# Edge function tests (security, output validation, Aitchison distance)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml run --rm edge-test-runner
```

### Local tests (without Docker)

Requires a running Supabase instance and Python venv:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/..
./run_test.sh                     # excludes slow tests
pytest                            # all tests including slow ones
pytest tests/auth/test_authentication.py -v   # single file
```

---

## Development Setup (Run Flask locally)

If you are a developer and prefer to run the Flask application directly on your machine (outside of Docker) so you can easily edit the code, while keeping the Supabase database inside Docker.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- Node.js 18.17+ (for Supabase CLI, optional)

### Supabase setup

1. Set your passwords and bootstrap:
    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    # Edit backend/.env with your passwords as described in the Quick Start
    bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
    ```

2. Start only the database and Supabase services (this will still run in Docker):
    ```bash
    cd backend
    docker compose up -d
    ```

### Flask setup

All commands below must be run from inside the `backend/` directory.

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Set up a Python virtual environment to isolate your dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Update your `backend/.env` file so the local Flask app knows how to connect to the Dockerized database. Change these values in your `.env` file:
    ```
    POSTGRES_HOST=127.0.0.1
    POSTGRES_PORT=5433
    SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```

    > **Important:** `bootstrap.sh` generates `backend/.env` with Docker-internal hostnames (`POSTGRES_HOST=db`, `POSTGRES_PORT=5432`, `SUPABASE_URL=http://kong:8000`) that only work inside the Docker network. The three values above must be changed **every time you re-run `bootstrap.sh`** when running Flask locally. If you skip this step, login will fail silently.

5. Start the Flask development server:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh
    ```

The application will now be running at `http://localhost:5000` and will automatically reload if you make changes to the Python code.

### Logging in for the first time

There is no default user account. You must register before you can log in:

1. Go to **http://localhost:5000/auth/register** and create an account with any email and password.
2. You will be redirected to **http://localhost:5000/auth/login** — use the same credentials to log in.

`ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM=true` is set by default, so no email verification is required.

## Setting Up RBAC for Your Institute

This is the end-to-end guide for an institute deploying FAIRDatabase from scratch and controlling who can do what. It assumes you have followed the Quick Start above and the stack is reachable on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Roles at a Glance

Every authenticated user holds **exactly one** role from `_fd.user_role`:

| Role           | Sign-up default? | Upload datasets | Modify datasets         | Read datasets                    | Manage roles | Manage grants            |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **admin**      | no               | yes             | any dataset             | any dataset                      | yes          | any dataset              |
| **curator**    | no               | yes             | datasets they own       | own + explicitly granted         | no           | datasets they own        |
| **accessor**   | no               | no              | no                      | only datasets explicitly granted | no           | no                       |
| **visualizer** | **yes**          | no              | no                      | catalog + aggregate stats only   | no           | no                       |

New sign-ups always land in `visualizer`. An admin must promote them before they can upload or read raw data.

### Step 1 — Bootstrap the First Admin

There is no admin account by default. The cleanest path is the boot-time bootstrap.

1. Decide which email will be the institute admin (e.g. `data-steward@your-institute.org`). This email must belong to a Supabase user, so register it first at `http://localhost:5000/auth/register`.
2. Set the email in `backend/.env`:
   ```
   ADMIN_EMAIL=data-steward@your-institute.org
   ```
3. Restart the Flask container (or the local Flask process):
   ```bash
   cd backend && docker compose restart flask-app
   ```
4. On boot, `_bootstrap_admin` (in `backend/app.py`) looks up that email via the Supabase admin API and **upserts** `_fd.user_roles` to `admin`. The action is idempotent — leave `ADMIN_EMAIL` set permanently if you want the admin role re-asserted on every boot (useful if someone accidentally demotes the admin).
5. Log in as that user. You should now see an **Admin** entry in the dashboard navigation; the admin console lives at `http://localhost:5000/admin/users`.

If you do not want a fixed admin (e.g. you are migrating from another system), you can bootstrap directly in Postgres instead:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c \
  "INSERT INTO _fd.user_roles (user_id, role, assigned_by)
   VALUES ('<uuid-from-supabase-studio>', 'admin', NULL)
   ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET role = 'admin';"
```

### Step 2 — Onboard New Users

There are two patterns; pick whichever fits your institute:

**Self-service (default).** Anyone can register at `http://localhost:5000/auth/register`. New accounts default to `visualizer` (catalog + aggregate stats only), so self-service is safe — they cannot reach raw data until an admin promotes them.

**Closed registration.** Set `DISABLE_SIGNUP=true` in `backend/.env` and re-run `bash scripts/bootstrap.sh` then `docker compose up -d`. New users must then be created by an admin via Supabase Studio (`http://localhost:3000` → Authentication → Users → *Add user*). The dashboard password is whatever you set as `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`.

Email verification is off by default (`ENABLE_EMAIL_AUTOCONFIRM=true`). Flip it to `false` if your institute requires email confirmation; then configure the `SMTP_*` variables.

### Step 3 — Assign Roles

Logged in as `admin`, go to `http://localhost:5000/admin/users`. The page lists every Supabase user with their current role and a dropdown to change it.

- **Promote a researcher to `curator`** so they can upload and own datasets.
- **Promote an analyst to `accessor`** so you can later grant them specific datasets.
- **Demote** a user back to `visualizer` to revoke all dataset access in one step.

Every change writes a row to `_fd.role_audit` recording who changed whom, when, and from what to what.

Programmatic alternative (admin only):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/admin/users/<user-uuid>/role \
  --cookie "session=<your-flask-session-cookie>" \
  -d "role=curator"
```

### Step 4 — Grant Dataset Access

Datasets are owned by whoever uploaded them (`metadata_tables.owner_id`). Owners — and any admin — can grant read access to other users.

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/dashboard/search` and find the dataset's metadata-table ID (visible to admins/owners).
2. Open `http://localhost:5000/admin/datasets/<dataset_id>/grants`.
3. Pick a user from the *Grant access* dropdown and submit. The grantee can now read that dataset via `/search`, `/display`, `/table_preview`, and the `get-dataset-visualization` edge function.
4. To revoke, click *Revoke* next to the user in the grants list.

Grants are scoped per dataset; there is no "read everything" grant short of the `admin` role. Every grant/revoke is recorded in `_fd.grant_audit`.

### Step 5 — Audit Changes

Two append-only audit tables capture every privileged action:

| Table              | Captures                                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_fd.role_audit`   | `user_id`, `old_role`, `new_role`, `changed_by`, `changed_at`                |
| `_fd.grant_audit`  | `dataset_id`, `user_id`, `action` (`granted`/`revoked`), `changed_by`, `at`  |

Inspect them via Supabase Studio (`http://localhost:3000` → Table Editor → `_fd` schema) or directly:

```bash
docker compose exec db psql -U postgres -c \
  "SELECT * FROM _fd.role_audit ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 20;"
```

Both tables are written by the Flask handlers in `backend/src/admin/form.py`. They are not exposed via the web UI — read them in Postgres if you need a compliance trail.

### Service Ports Reference

| Port  | Service                | Bound by             | Used for                                                |

| 5000  | Flask app              | `flask-app` container | User-facing UI; admin console; auth routes              |
| 3000  | Supabase Studio        | `studio` container   | DB inspection; manual user creation; viewing audit logs |
| 8000  | Supabase Kong (API)    | `kong` container     | Auth + edge functions (called by the Flask app)         |
| 5433  | PostgreSQL (host map)  | `db` container       | Local Flask → DB; `psql` from your machine              |
| 5432  | PostgreSQL (in-network)| `db` container       | Service-to-service inside the Docker network only       |

If any of these collide with another service on the host, change the host-side port mapping in `backend/docker-compose.yml` (left side of `host:container`). Do **not** change the in-container ports — they are referenced by other Supabase services.

### Operational Notes

- **Defense in depth.** RBAC is enforced at three layers: the Flask `@login_required(*roles)` decorator, handler-side ownership/grant checks (`backend/src/dashboard/helpers.py`), and Postgres RLS policies (`backend/rbac_schema.sql`). The Flask DB user is currently a superuser, so RLS protects only direct DB / edge-function callers — layers 1 and 2 are load-bearing for the web app. See `CLAUDE.md` for how to tighten this if you want RLS to bite on the Flask path too.
- **Edge functions** at `/functions/v1/get-dataset-stats` and `/functions/v1/get-dataset-visualization` re-check role + ownership/grant via `supabase/functions/_shared/authz.ts`. They are safe to expose to first-party clients (e.g. an institute portal) using a user JWT.
- **Schema migrations** for the RBAC tables live in `backend/rbac_schema.sql` and re-apply on every Flask boot. Safe to re-run; no destructive operations.
- **Disabling auto-promotion.** Once your team is set up, you can leave `ADMIN_EMAIL` set (idempotent re-assertion) or clear it. Clearing has no effect on existing roles — it only stops the boot-time check.

#### `/functions/v1/get-dataset-stats` (**POST**) – Aggregate dataset statistics. **Requires: authenticated JWT**

Returns statistics for all datasets the caller is authorized to read.

**Authorization:** Requests must include a valid Supabase JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Service-role tokens see all datasets; user tokens see only their own + granted datasets.

#### Request:
```json
{ }
```

#### `/functions/v1/get-dataset-visualization` (**POST**) – Visualization data for a dataset. **Requires: authenticated JWT**

Returns visualization metadata for a specific table if the caller is authorized.

**Authorization:** User must own the dataset or have an explicit grant. Non-existent datasets return 404 (not 403) to avoid leaking existence.

#### Request:
```json
{
  "table_name": "mydata_p1"
}
```

#### Responses:
- **200**: Visualization data for the requested table.
- **400**: Missing table_name or query error.
- **401**: Missing or invalid Authorization header.
- **403**: User not authorized to access this table (also returned for non-existent tables to avoid existence leaks).
